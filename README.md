# Password Validation
Kata got from https://www.codurance.com/katalyst/password-validation.

## Practice objectives
- TDD
- VS Code shortcuts

## Brief Explanation
Design and implement a software that validates a password applying TDD.

The password will be introduced by the user (as an argument of the method) and should return if the password is valid or not.

A valid password should meet the following requirements:

- Have more than 8 characters
- Contains a capital letter
- Contains a lowercase
- Contains a number
- Contains an underscore

Futher iterations add more functionality (see link above).
